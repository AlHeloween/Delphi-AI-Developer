# LGPD Compliance

The LGPD, or General Law for the Protection of Personal Data (Law No. 13.709/2018), is the Brazilian legislation that regulates the use, collection, storage and sharing of personal data of individuals in Brazil.

## Introduction
**Delphi AI Developer** was developed for use in Delphi IDE in compliance with the guidelines of the General Law on the Protection of Personal Data (LGPD), ensuring that user data is not used by us.

## Data Collection and Use
**Delphi AI Developer** uses Artificial Intelligence APIs to enhance the programming experience and facilitate interaction with the database structure. When operating, the plugin:
- **Sends code snippets and database structure to Artificial Intelligence APIs**, aiming to provide suggestions and automation in development.
- **Does not store any user information on external servers**, including code snippets, database structure or other personal data.

## Database Structure Storage
The plugin **does not access, store or send data from the database** itself. Only the **database structure** is used, including the database name, table names, field names, field data types and field sizes. This structure is **stored locally in a JSON file** on the user's own computer, without being exposed to any server or external source. This local storage aims to optimize the plugin's performance and interaction with the APIs, while maintaining data security and privacy.

## Data Subject Rights
Although Delphi AI Developer does not collect or store personal data, users can request more information about the functioning and data processing at any time. For questions related to the use of data by the tool, please contact **[contato@code4delphi.com.br](mailto:contato@code4delphi.com.br)**.

## Segurança e Privacidade
O Delphi AI Developer adota medidas de segurança rigorosas para proteger as interações entre o plugin e as APIs de Inteligência Artificial, além de garantir que o arquivo JSON local seja seguro e acessível apenas ao usuário. Todo o processamento de dados é feito com transparência e alinhado aos princípios da LGPD.

## Privacy Policy Updates
Any changes in LGPD compliance or data usage practices will be added to this page.
